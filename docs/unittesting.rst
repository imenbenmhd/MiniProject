Unit tests
============

Unit tests are seperated in 4 files to test the module : preprocessor, database, algorithm and analysis.
You can execute them all by installing the library nose and run the command nosetests: 

.. code-block:: shell

  (project) $ pip3 install nose
  (project) $ nosetests tgibm
