# Mini-Project

This repository contains mini-projects for two datasets:
* [Dataset 1](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/wine+quality): Wine quality (prediction of wine quality based on their intrinsic properties; contains 2 sub-datasets, for red and white wine)
* [Dataset 2](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/housing/): Boston House Prices (prediction of house prices in Boston based on different numeric and categorical features)

Both datasets were retrieved from the UCI Machine Learning Repositories, and can be found in the folder [Data](https://github.com/imenbenmhd/MiniProject/tree/preprocessor/Data).

## Description

For both datasets, two Machine Learning approaches are used for the prediction:
* Linear Regression
* Regression Trees

## Prerequisites

In order to run these scripts, the installation of [Python](https://www.python.org/) is necessary.
