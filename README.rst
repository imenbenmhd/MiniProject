 Mini project - Analysis of multiple datasets
============================================================

---------------------------------------------------------
Summary
---------------------------------------------------------

The goal of this project is to apply reproducible research principles
to the problems of different types of wine quality and Boston house pricing prediction.

-----------
Data Source
-----------

This repository contains mini-projects for two datasets:

- `Dataset 1 <https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/wine+quality>`__: Wine quality (prediction of wine quality based on their intrinsic properties; contains 2 sub-datasets, for red and white wine)

- `Dataset 2 <https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/housing/>`__: Boston House Prices (prediction of house prices in Boston based on different numeric and categorical features)

Both datasets were retrieved from the UCI Machine Learning Repositories, and can be found in the folder `Data <https://github.com/imenbenmhd/MiniProject/tree/preprocessor/Data>`__.

-----------
Description
-----------

For both datasets, two Machine Learning approaches are used for the prediction:

- Linear Regression

- Regression Trees

-----------
Prerequisites
-----------

In order to run these scripts, the installation of `Python <https://www.python.org/>`__ is necessary.
